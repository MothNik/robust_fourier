Module :mod:`hermite_functions._numba_funcs`

This module provides Numba-based implementations of the Hermite functions.

Depending on the runtime availability of Numba, the functions are either compiled or
imported from the NumPy-based implementation.

    Notes
    -----
    Direct evaluation of the Hermite polynomials becomes ill-conditioned in finite
    precision since it involves the division of a polynomial by the square root of
    a factorial of ``n`` which is prone to overflow.
    To avoid this, the recurrence relation of the Hermite functions is used to compute
    the values in a numerically stable way.
    However, there will still be underflow of the Gaussian part of the Hermite function
    for large values of ``x``. Therefore, a special scaling strategy is employed that
    keeps the values of the Hermite functions at a scale of roughly 1 during the
    recursion while tracking a correction term that is added to the exponent of the
    Gaussian part of the Hermite function.
