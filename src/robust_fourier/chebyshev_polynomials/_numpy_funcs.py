    combined recurrence relation.

    Parameters

        The values of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind evaluated at the
        points ``x`` represented as a Vandermonde matrix.

    chebyshev_u2_vander : :class:`numpy.ndarray` of shape (m, n + 1)

    Notes
    -----
    The naive three-term recurrence relations for Chebyshev polynomials of the first and
    second kind have bad numerical properties because the error is increasing
    proportional to ``n * n``, i.e., quadratically with the order of the polynomial
    ``n``.
    However, a combined recurrence relation that links both kinds of Chebyshev
    polynomials has an error proportional to ``n``, i.e., a linear increase with the
    order of the polynomial ``n``. Already for ``n`` as little as ``4``, the combined
    recurrence relation outperforms the naive three-term recurrence relations. So, the
    roughly doubled computational cost of the combined recurrence relation is justified.
    On top of that, a combined evaluation offers the opportunity to easily compute the
    derivatives of the Chebyshev polynomials because the derivatives of the first kind
    are related to the polynomials of the second kind and vice versa.
