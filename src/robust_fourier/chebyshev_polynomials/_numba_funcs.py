Module :mod:`chebyshev_polynomials._numba_funcs`

This module provides Numba-based implementations of the Chebyshev polynomials of the
first and second kind.

Depending on the runtime availability of Numba, the functions are either compiled or
imported from the NumPy-based implementation.

        Notes
        -----
        The naive three-term recurrence relations for Chebyshev polynomials of the first
        and second kind have bad numerical properties because the error is increasing
        proportional to ``n * n``, i.e., quadratically with the order of the polynomial
        ``n``.
        However, a combined recurrence relation that links both kinds of Chebyshev
        polynomials has an error proportional to ``n``, i.e., a linear increase with the
        order of the polynomial ``n``. Already for ``n`` as little as ``4``, the
        combined recurrence relation outperforms the naive three-term recurrence
        relations. So, the roughly doubled computational cost of the combined recurrence
        relation is justified.
        On top of that, a combined evaluation offers the opportunity to easily compute
        the derivatives of the Chebyshev polynomials because the derivatives of the
        first kind are related to the polynomials of the second kind and vice versa.
